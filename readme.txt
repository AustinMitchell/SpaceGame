Instructions to play are in the game, just click the instructions button.
Essentially use arrow keys or wasd to move, space to shoot. Collect powerups
and weapons, try to get highest score. Avoid enemies and their bullets.

1. Screen is 1000x500, monitors are never less wide than 1000 pixels
2. Game requires dexterity and timing to be successful
3. Game ends after all your health is lost
4. Score is displayed on the corner, and after you die.
5. An event counter sets an event to go off every seven seconds. These events
typically increase the enemies' capabilities or makes it harder for the player
to get through the game, so difficulty increases over time. Game can become
very difficult as the even timer can also speed up
6. As far as I can tell, errors are non existant (lots of playtesting)
7. There's soundtracks and explosion effects.
8. ^^
9. There's a game menu screen, instruction screen and death screen.

Just note that the game has just as much chance at being seemingly easy as
it does being difficult. It's mostly luck of the draw here
